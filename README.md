Our students often lose their belongings. And do not know where to look, or if they find someone's thing, again do not know where to place. There is an instagram where sometimes post about finds and losses, but not all see it, or do not use instagram. Our site will be accessible to each of our students. With the help of our website, students will be able to find their belongings or return other people's things to the owner. Software Features List :
